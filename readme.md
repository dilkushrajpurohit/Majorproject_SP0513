// --------------------Main idea:- creating an express-like app named neuroninjas 
//breaking the promblem in various steps:-
// neuroninjas.get()
neuroninjas.post()
neuroninjas.listen()
neuroninjas.use()

**************thsese all functionalities should work 

architecture :- 
1.http server is created 
2.http request 
3. middleware is integrated ---> request aur response ka beech mai hota hai aur next ko  transfer kar deta hai 
4. route is defined 
5. handler is defined 
6. response is send


//------------first create a main class neuroninjas 
then various methods like get ,post ,listen will be created
